# Our user server is named `castillo` on the interface that faces users
# but it's name `visnu` on the interface that has a fast link to the cluster.
#
# All the references from the cluster to that node,
# which contains most of the user files used for analyses,
# are thus made to the internal reference.
#
# Most of the cluster configuration is stored in template files
# each one configuring all the servers.
#
# The configuration for each server usually needs to remove itself
# from the configuration file.
#
# As this was a common task,
# and as aliases make this task a little complex,
# this script is the cannonical place to implement this mechanism
# so that we Don't Repeat (Y)ourselves.

# Interface

#
# Selfâ€“references are detected by searching our
HOSTNAME="$(hostname)"
#
# Aliases are stored on the
ALIAS_CONFIG_FILE="/etc/cluster/hostname-aliases/${HOSTNAME}"
# which is named after the HOSTNAME
#
# if the ALIAS_CONFIG_FILE exists
# then we use it for filtering
#
test -e ${ALIAS_CONFIG_FILE}\
&& OPTS="-e ${ALIAS_CONFIG_FILE}"
#
# After we detected wether we should use the ALIAS_CONFIG_FILE
# we exec to grep which handles the reference removal.
#
# If the filter do not find references it will exit 0 just the same.
# This differs from grep behavior which can be used for tests.
#
# This behavior it's needed by `/etc/cron.hourly/configurador`
# as a process blocks the following ones.
#
grep \
	-v \
	-e "${HOSTNAME}" \
	${OPTS} \
	"${@}" \
|| true
